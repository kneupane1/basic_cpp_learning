Lesson 1...
Chapter 1. To make a runable program using terminal:

g++ -std=c++0x helloWoeld.cpp -o example_program

to run:

./example_program


Chapter 2. Variables and types :  char (least 8 bits), int (least 8 bits){short 16 bits, long 32, long long 64},float (32 bits, long 64 bits), boolean

1 byte = 8 bits = 8 bits have 2^8 notes = 256 unique re-presentable values.
Signed/Unsigned Variable Type of Integer:
An unsigned variable type of int can hold zero and positive numbers, and a signed int holds negative, zero and positive numbers.

In 32-bit integers, an unsigned integer has a range of 0 to 232-1 = 0 to 4,294,967,295 or about 4 billion. The signed version goes from -231-1 to 231, which is
